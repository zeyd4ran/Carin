## Where things live

_Populate as you build — short repo map plus pointers to the source-of-truth file for DB schema, API contracts, theme files, etc._

## Architecture decisions

_Populate as you build — non-obvious choices a reader couldn't infer from the code (3-5 bullets)._

## Product

_Describe the high-level user-facing capabilities of this app once they exist._

## User preferences

_Populate as you build — explicit user instructions worth remembering across sessions._

## Gotchas

_Populate as you build — sharp edges, "always run X before Y" rules._

## Pointers

- The root `package.json` defines the npm workspace packages and shared scripts
